# Rust Learning - Shadowing

[Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing)

You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable shadows the previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variableâ€™s value is what appears when the variable is used.

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as ```mut```.
