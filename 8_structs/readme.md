# Rust Learning - Using Structs to Structure Related Data

[Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html)

A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. 

A struct is like an object’s data attributes. 

Unlike with tuples, you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. 

To define a struct, we enter the keyword ```struct``` and name the entire struct.
