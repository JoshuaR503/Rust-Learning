# Rust Learning

### Notes
By default variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. 

Arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.

Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand.

### Rust conventions
Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words, and underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability.

Rust code uses snake case as the conventional style for function and variable names.
