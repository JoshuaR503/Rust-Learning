# Rust Learning

### Notes
By default variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. 

Arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.

### Rust conventions
Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words, and underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability.
