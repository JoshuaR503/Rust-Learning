    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    // An example of when you might want to use an array rather than a vector is in a program that needs to know the names of the months of the year. Itâ€™s very unlikely that such a program will need to add or remove months, so you can use an array because you know it will always contain 12 elements:
    let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
}
