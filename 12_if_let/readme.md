[Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-03-if-let.html)

### Notes
Using if let means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.

If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to express using a match, remember that if let is in your Rust toolbox as well.
