# Rust Learning - Functions

[Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html)

### Notes
Function definitions in Rust start with ```fn``` and have a set of parentheses after the function name.

Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere.

In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter.
